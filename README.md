## Suggestions :

     · It is recommended to concentrate on week end sales, and to provide any special offers so as to increase the sales.

     · The company can provide any vouchers or special discounts for credit card payments which may improve customer satifaction and accordingly will reflect on customer reviews.

     · The company can bring more competetive prices to increase the sales and to attract the customers.

     · Since the long delivery/shipping days affects the customer satsifaction, company shall focus on increasing the delivery methods as much as possible to reduce the shipping days.

     · The customer’s review is mostly limited to review score, only (30-40)% of total reviews have the proper feedbacks. Hence the company shall implement any new methods/conduct surveys that might let the them       understand the customer’s thought on their products & services.
